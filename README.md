## 💡 About me

Student (second course) from Russia, Dzerzhinsk. I have experience in creating cross-platform applications (written in Rust) that can run on Windows and Linux.

**My skills:**

- 🦀 **Rust:** [iced](https://iced.rs) (pure Rust GUI library), `reqwest`, `tokio`, `serde`
- 🐍 **Python:** simple CLI-utilities, automatization scripts
- 🌍 **English:** my English is very bad :-(
- 🛠 `git`, Linux
